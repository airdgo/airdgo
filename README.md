## Hi there, I'm Vlad 👋

🔭 I'm a software developer who loves diving into backend technologies. I have a background in aerospace engineering, and I'm interested in code, sports, and science. I’m all about that growth mindset—constantly learning and exploring new things that catch my interest.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Programming languages**: Python | TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI | Flask | NestJS | Express | SQL databases
- **Tools**: Docker | Git

🎲 When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me hitting the trails on my mountain bike, running or swimming
